# Usability Heuristics for User Interface Design

In this exercise we will look at a software or site and point out some posivites and negatives based on the heuristics in [this site](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/).

For this exercise i chose to look at [ByteBoost's Team Site](https://byte-boost-team-website.vercel.app/).

### 1: Visibility of System Status

The site clearly makes visible when a card is being hovered on, by making the card bigger and its constrast colours being different than the unhovered cards. This helps with visibilty since the user will know which card is being hovered on easily.
  
### 3: User Control and Freedom

When the card is flipped or unflipped theres a text indicating that the card can be unflipped or flipped by clicking on the card. There could be a better way to show this more clearly but it stills helps the user not be confused if the card can be flipped or not.

### 7: Flexibility and Efficiency of Use

The site presents some poor keyboard support, the cards do not flip until you click on a link that is on the other side of the card and the navegation can be confused since the links behind the card are selectable even without being visible.
