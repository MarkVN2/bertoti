>"We see three critical differences between programming and software engineering: time, scale, and the trade-offs at play. On a software engineering project, engineers need to be more concerned with the passage of time and the eventual need for change. In a software engineering organization, we need to be more concerned about scale and efficiency, both for the software we produce as well as for the organization that is producing it. Finally, as software engineers, we are asked to make more complex decisions with higher-stakes outcomes, often based on imprecise estimates of time and growth."

Na Engenharia de Software há de se ter uma grande enfase no planejamento futuro de um projeto e sua capacidade de crescer, independente do tamanho do projeto seja ele uma aplicação simples para compartilhamento de videos, em todos os projetos se tem de pensar nos hardwares do futuro e a compatibilidade do software, a capacidade de um aplicativo de escalar com a quantidade de usuarios.

>"Within Google, we sometimes say, “Software engineering is programming integrated over time.” Programming is certainly a significant part of software engineering: after all, programming is how you generate new software in the first place. If you accept this distinction, it also becomes clear that we might need to delineate between programming tasks (development) and software engineering tasks (development, modification, maintenance). The addition of time adds an important new dimension to programming. Cubes aren’t squares, distance isn’t velocity. Software engineering isn’t programming."

Para a Google a Engenharia de Software é um processo construtivo onde se vai construindo o software com o tempo mas não é só desenvolver, se tem de pensar na manuntenção e modificação desse software.
